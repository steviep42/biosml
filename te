it's okay to complain about tech companies but also shine some light on the campus gatekeepers who come back from EDUCAUSE proclaiming breathlessly that "we simply MUST get into analytics". Many times this comes from the seemingly infinite ranks of administrators (vice, deputy, assistant, associate) who have never even taught !


Also, it doesn't help that campus CIOs are, (and have been), increasingly non technical so there are few in the organization who can reasonably evaluate technology or implement it. And forget about Experimental Design which is totally lacking in any of the discussions when campuses implement these frame works. Establishing a baseline is very important as are generating testable hypotheses.


In absence of that, it's just someone's pet tech project (that might cost in the millions) gone off the rails. Sure, doing exploratory analysis on data can lead to some interesting hypotheses although isn't it interesting that, once again, Administration wants to examine the behavior of every one OTHER than themselves ?
